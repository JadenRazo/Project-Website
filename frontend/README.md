# Project Website Frontend

My portfolio website frontend, built with React and TypeScript, and styled using styled-components and TailwindCSS. I designed it to be modern, responsive, and highly interactive, showcasing my portfolio of projects, developer tools, and real-time statistics.

## Features

- **Project Showcase:** Interactive cards display detailed information about each project, including technologies used, live demos, and GitHub links.
- **Live Code Statistics:** The total lines of code across all major projects are displayed, updated automatically via backend scripts using [tokei](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei).
- **Real-Time Tools:** Integrations for DevPanel, Messaging, and URL Shortener, each with their own dedicated pages.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Dark/Light Theme Support:** Easily switch between themes using the navigation bar.
- **Smooth Animations:** Uses framer-motion for smooth transitions and interactive UI elements.
- **Performance Optimizations:** Custom hooks and best practices for fast, efficient rendering.

## Project Structure

- `src/pages/Projects/index.tsx` — Main projects page, including the code stats feature and project cards.
- `src/components/` — Reusable UI components (NavigationBar, Footer, Layout, etc.).
- `src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx` — Theme provider and context for dark/light mode.
- `src/styles/` — Global styles and theme definitions.
- `src/types/` — Custom TypeScript type declarations
- `src/assets/data/code_stats.json` — Auto-generated file with up-to-date lines of code stats (do not edit manually).

## How the Codebase Works

- **Frontend:**
  - Built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and TypeScript.
  - Uses [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for theming and custom styles.
  - Animations and transitions are handled by [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/).
  - Project and code stats data are fetched from static JSON files generated by backend scripts.

- **Lines of Code Stats:**
  - A backend shell script runs [tokei](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei) on all major project directories.
  - The script outputs a `code_stats.json` file in the `src/assets/data/` directory.
  - The frontend fetches this file on the Projects page and displays the total lines of code.
  - The script is run on server startup and every hour via a cron job to keep stats up to date.

- **WebSocket/Real-Time Features:**
  - Some pages (e.g., DevPanel, Messaging) may attempt to connect to backend WebSocket endpoints for real-time updates. If the backend is not running or accessible, you may see connection errors in the browser console (these do not affect the main site functionality).

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

   **For a fresh start (recommended if experiencing cache issues):**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:fresh
   ```

3. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Deployment

- I've configured the app ready for deployment as a static site after running `npm run build`.
- Ensure the backend script is configured to update `src/assets/data/code_stats.json` regularly for live code stats.

## Key Technologies
- React 18
- TypeScript
- styled-components
- framer-motion
- TailwindCSS
- react-icons
- Create React App
- CRACO (Create React App Configuration Override)

## Troubleshooting

### Browser Cache Issues in Development

If you're experiencing issues where code changes aren't reflected in the browser:

1. **Use the fresh start command:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:fresh
   ```
   This clears all caches before starting the development server.

2. **Manually clear caches:**
   ```bash
   npm run clear-cache
   ```

3. **In the browser console (development mode only):**
   ```javascript
   window.__clearAllCaches()
   ```

4. **Hard refresh the browser:**
   - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

5. **Check for service workers:**
   - Open DevTools → Application → Service Workers
   - Unregister any service workers for localhost

### Development Configuration

The project uses CRACO to customize the webpack configuration without ejecting from Create React App. Key configurations:

- **Cache busting headers** are automatically set in development
- **Service workers** are automatically unregistered on startup
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** is configured for instant updates
- **Development environment variables** are in `.env.development`

### Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Start development server (uses CRACO)
- `npm run build` - Create production build (uses CRACO)
- `npm test` - Run tests (uses CRACO)
- `npm run clear-cache` - Clear all development caches
- `npm run dev:fresh` - Clear caches and start fresh
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run lint:fix` - Auto-fix linting issues
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run type-check` - Check TypeScript types
