# Project Website Frontend

This is the frontend for the Project Website, built with React and TypeScript, and styled using styled-components and TailwindCSS. It is designed to be modern, responsive, and highly interactive, showcasing a portfolio of projects, developer tools, and real-time statistics.

## Features

- **Project Showcase:** Interactive cards display detailed information about each project, including technologies used, live demos, and GitHub links.
- **Live Code Statistics:** The total lines of code across all major projects are displayed, updated automatically via backend scripts using [tokei](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei).
- **Real-Time Tools:** Integrations for DevPanel, Messaging, and URL Shortener, each with their own dedicated pages.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Dark/Light Theme Support:** Easily switch between themes using the navigation bar.
- **Smooth Animations:** Uses framer-motion for smooth transitions and interactive UI elements.
- **Performance Optimizations:** Custom hooks and best practices for fast, efficient rendering.

## Project Structure

- `src/pages/Projects/index.tsx` — Main projects page, including the code stats feature and project cards.
- `src/components/` — Reusable UI components (NavigationBar, Footer, Layout, etc.).
- `src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx` — Theme provider and context for dark/light mode.
- `src/styles/` — Global styles and theme definitions.
- `src/types/` — Custom TypeScript type declarations
- `public/code_stats.json` — Auto-generated file with up-to-date lines of code stats (do not edit manually).

## How the Codebase Works

- **Frontend:**
  - Built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and TypeScript.
  - Uses [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for theming and custom styles.
  - Animations and transitions are handled by [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/).
  - Project and code stats data are fetched from static JSON files generated by backend scripts.

- **Lines of Code Stats:**
  - A backend shell script runs [tokei](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei) on all major project directories.
  - The script outputs a `code_stats.json` file in the `public/` directory.
  - The frontend fetches this file on the Projects page and displays the total lines of code.
  - The script is run on server startup and every hour via a cron job to keep stats up to date.

- **WebSocket/Real-Time Features:**
  - Some pages (e.g., DevPanel, Messaging) may attempt to connect to backend WebSocket endpoints for real-time updates. If the backend is not running or accessible, you may see connection errors in the browser console (these do not affect the main site functionality).

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

3. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Deployment

- The app is ready to be deployed as a static site after running `npm run build`.
- Ensure the backend script is configured to update `public/code_stats.json` regularly for live code stats.
